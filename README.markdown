## About *penguin*	

Penguin was a project I embarked on at the tender age of 13. I wanted a meaty C++ project that involved a strong object heirarchy and algorithms I would have to design myself. I picked a GUI toolkit because I was developing games using the Allegro graphics library under DOS (using the DJCPP compiler) and I wanted a powerful GUI to enrich my other projects.

I invented the fragment- and window-management code myself in a bottom-up design kind of way. I based the event system and layout management on Java's SWING.

The resulting system took me about a year to write. While single-threaded, it was performant enough to run under DOS, Windows, and Linux using only Allegro's software-rendering. It could support transparency, drop-shadows, and all kinds of effects. 

I based the look-and-feel on Windows 98, which I was using at the time, but I pursued skinning to emulate MacOS's Aqua look-and-feel as well. 

I wrote a 200-page Word document that detailed the design and implemntation of the system, which you can find *here*.
